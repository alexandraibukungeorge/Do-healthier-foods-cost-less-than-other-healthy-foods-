Whole Foods Market Analysis: A Data-Driven Approach to Healthy Food Pricing and Market Strategy


The primary question that this project answers is:

"Do healthier foods (low sodium & low fat) cost less than other healthy foods?"
(And what does this mean for pricing strategy, market targeting, and business insights?)

The Data & Hypothesis Tested
To answer this, I framed a hypothesis test:

Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ): Healthier foods do not cost less than other healthy foods.
Alternative Hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ): Healthier foods cost less than other healthy foods.

The SQL queries extracted, processed, and analyzed food pricing data to test this hypothesis. SQL Queries and Insights Extracted:

1. Classifying Foods into "Healthier" vs. "Healthy"

  - Used SQL CASE statements to categorize foods based on low sodium & low fat content.

2Ô∏è. Calculating and Comparing Prices

  - Computed average & total prices for both categories.
  - Found that healthier foods were priced higher on average.

3. Statistical Hypothesis Testing (T-Test)

  - Used SQL to calculate means, standard deviations, and sample sizes for both food groups.
  - Computed t-value to determine if the price difference was statistically significant.

4. Business Insights from the Data

  - Identified that vegan and vegetarian foods make up a large market share.
  - Found an inventory gap in healthier foods, suggesting an opportunity for expansion.

Final Answer to the Question

üö® Healthier foods (low sodium & low fat) do NOT cost less than other healthy foods.
üí° Business Impact: Whole Foods (or similar retailers) should justify premium pricing through marketing & customer loyalty programs rather than price cuts.
üìà Market Strategy: Targeting vegan & vegetarian consumers with community-driven campaigns can improve brand loyalty and customer acquisition.
üì¶ Inventory Optimization: Expanding healthier food options based on demand data can increase profitability.
